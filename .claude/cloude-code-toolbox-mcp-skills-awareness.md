# Cloude Code ToolBox — MCP & Skills awareness

_Generated: 2026-09-29T16:43:39.122Z_

## How to use this report

- **Saved copy:** This file is **`.claude/cloude-code-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md`** — refreshed whenever the toolbox runs an MCP & Skills scan (including on workspace open when auto-scan is enabled). It is meant for **Claude Code workspace context** together with `CLAUDE.md` (which gets a shorter replaceable summary when auto-merge is on).
- **MCP:** Lists **configured** servers from Claude Code config (`~/.claude.json` for user scope, `.mcp.json` for project scope). Use `/mcp` in the Claude Code panel to connect servers for your session.
- **Skills:** **On-disk** folders with `SKILL.md`. Claude Code does not auto-load them; attach `SKILL.md` or paths in chat when useful.
- **Task routing:** When the user’s request matches a server’s purpose (e.g. Confluence → Confluence/Atlassian MCP), prefer that **server id** from the tables below.

## Suggested next steps

- **MCP:** Use this extension’s hub **MCP** tab, or `claude mcp list` in the terminal. In Claude Code, use `/mcp` to connect servers for the session.
- **Edit config:** Open `~/.claude.json` (user MCP) or `<workspace>/.mcp.json` (project MCP) via the extension commands.
- **Refresh this report:** run **Intelligence — scan MCP & Skills awareness** again after changing MCP config or adding skills.
