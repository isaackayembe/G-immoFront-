### MCP & Skills awareness (Cloude Code ToolBox)

_Last synced: 2026-09-29T16:43:39.233Z._

- **Full report:** `.claude/cloude-code-toolbox-mcp-skills-awareness.md` in this workspace (auto-overwritten on each scan). Use it as ground truth for configured servers and skill folders.
- **MCP:** For **live tools** in Claude Code, enable the matching server via `/mcp`. Servers are configured in `~/.claude.json` (user) and `.mcp.json` (project).
- **When the user’s task matches a server** (e.g. Confluence work and a **Confluence** / **Atlassian** MCP is listed), **prefer that server id** and plan on tool use—not only file search.
- **Skills:** Folders below contain `SKILL.md`; attach or cite paths in chat when relevant.
